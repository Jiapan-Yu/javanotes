\section{Caveats}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``Intellij IDEA run button grayed out''?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Right click the folder containing your source
\item Select Mark Directory as $\rightarrow$ Test Source Root
\end{enumerate}


\end{itemize}


\section{Hello World}
\subsection{Hello Java File!}
HelloYou.java

\begin{verbatim}
public class HelloYou {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello Joshua!");
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
\verb|println| is short for ``print line''. It has to be double quotes inside \verb|println|

\subsection{Commenting Code}
When comments are short we use the single-line syntax: \verb|//|.

When comments are long we use the multi-line syntax: \verb|/*| and \verb|*/|.

\subsection{Semicolons and Whitespace}
Java does not interpret \textit{whitespace}, the areas of the code without syntax, but humans use whitespace to read code without difficulty.

Java \textbf{does} interpret semicolons. Semicolons are used to mark the end of a statement, one line of code that performs a single task.

Let's contrast statements with the curly brace, \verb|{}|. Curly braces mark the scope of our classes and methods. There are no semicolons at the end of a curly brace.

\subsection{Compilation: Catching Errors}
with a file called Plankton.java, we could compile it with the terminal command:

\verb|javac Plankton.java|

A successful compilation produces a \verb|.class| file: \verb|Plankton.class|, that we execute with the terminal command:

\verb|java Plankton|


\section{Java Program Structure}
Java is a case-sensitive language.

\subsection{Classes}
All Java programs are made of at least one class. The class name must match the file: our file is \textbf{HelloWorld.java} and our class is \verb|HelloWorld|. We capitalize every word, a style known as \textit{pascal case}. Java variables and methods are named in a similar style called \textit{camel case} where every word \textbf{after the first} is capitalized.

\subsection{Methods}
Every Java program must have a method called \verb|main()|. A method is a sequence of tasks for the computer to execute. This \verb|main()| method holds all of the instructions for our program.

\href{https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/java/com/twitter/common/styleguide.md#dont-embed-metadata-in-variable-names}{Don't embed metadata in variable names} seems differenct from JavaScript


\section{Variables}
\textit{Primitive datatypes} are types of data built-in to the Java system

\verb|int double boolean char|

The \verb|char| data type which store \textit{single character} can hold any character, like a letter, space, or punctuation mark. It must be surrounded by single quotes, '. For example:
\verb|char punctuation = '!';|

So far, we have learned primitive data types, which are the simplest types of data with no built-in behavior. Our programs will also use \verb|String|s, which store multiple characters using double quotes, which are objects, instead of primitives. Objects have built-in behavior.

A variable starts with a valid letter, or a \verb|$|, or a \verb|_|.


\section{Manipulating Variables}
With objects, such as \verb|String|s, we can't use the primitive equality operator. To test equality with \verb|String|s, we use a built-in method called \verb|.equals()|.
\subsection{String Concatenation}
The \verb|+| operator can be used to concatenate \verb|String|s.
\begin{verbatim}
// can be primitive datatype as well, Java will intelligently make it a 
// String first
String username = "PrinceNelson";
System.out.println("Your username is: " + username);
\end{verbatim}


\section{Introduction to Classes}
\subsection{Classes: Syntax}
The fundamental concept of object-oriented programming is the class. Every program has at least one class
\begin{verbatim}
public class Car {
// scope of Car class starts after curly brace

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // scope of main() starts after curly brace

    // program tasks

  }
  // scope of main() ends after curly brace

}
// scope of Car class ends after curly brace
\end{verbatim}
This example defines a \verb|class| named \verb|Car|. \verb|public| is an \textit{access level modifier} that allows \textbf{other} classes to interact with this class.

\subsection{Classes: Constructors}
We create objects (instances of a class) using a constructor method. See java.pdf for an example

\subsection{Classes: Instance Fields}
We'll add associated data to an object by introducing instance variables, or instance fields. Instance fields are the state in our objects. See java.pdf for an example

\subsection{Classes: Constructor Parameters}
Parameters specify the type and name of data available for reference within a method's scope. See java.pdf for an example

\subsection{Classes: Assigning Values to Instance Fields}
Now that our constructor has a parameter, we must pass values into the method call. These values become the state of the instance. See java.pdf for an example



\section{Miscellaneous}

\begin{enumerate}
\item MySql用得比较多

\item 在谈到Java开发人员经常使用的Java版本时，Java 8是胜利者。但应该记住，在2019年1月之后，Java 8将不再有公开更新。谈到Java开发人员最经常使用的IDE/编辑器时，IntelliJ IDEA看起来是明显的赢家。 \url{https://www.sohu.com/a/235541971_100159565}
